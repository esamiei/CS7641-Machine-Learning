Procedure to run the codes:

1.  The folder has been named "esamiei3_CS7641_Proj3_codes". This folder contains the following files
	1. "Images" folder -> all the figures generated after running the notebooks will be saved in this folder
	2. Requirements.txt -> this file may be used to install all the necessary dependencies 
	3. README.txt -> this is the same file which has been directly uploaded to the Assignment project in Canvas 
	4. Two datasets in the format of csv files; Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin.csv and heart.csv
	5. Two Jupyter notebooks:
		The notebook for the Breast Cancer dataset is named "UL_Project3_DS1.ipynb".
		The notebook for the Heart Disease dataset is named "UL_Project3_DS2.ipynb".

3. If it is necessary, install the dependencies from Terminal; Otherwise move to item 4

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook under the root folder 'esamiei3_CS7641_Proj3_codes':

jupyter notebook


5. Each dataset has its dedicated notebook: one for Breast Cancer and another for Heart Disease. Both csv files are stored in the root folder.

The notebook for the Breast Cancer dataset is named "UL_Project3_DS1.ipynb".
The notebook for the Heart Disease dataset is named "UL_Project3_DS2.ipynb".


6. Once jupyter notebook is open, you can run each cell directly.

7. Plots will be saved in the "Images" folder.
